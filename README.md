What is it
----------

A [Gradle](http://gradle.org) plugin to find duplicate code using [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net)s copy/paste detection (= [CPD][]).


Requirements
------------

Currently this plugin requires [PMD]() greater or equal to version 5.2 such that ```toolVersion >= v5.2.0```.

Explaination: As [PMD]()s source code and artifacts were modularized into modules for every language with v5.2.0 (see
[Changelog - 5.2.0](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-5.2.0/overview/changelog.html)) this plugin uses the
'pmd-dist' dependency by default.  This dependency further includes 'pmd-core', 'pmd-java', 'pmd-cpp',
... transitively. This also forces proper working of ```toolVersion``` to [PMD]() v5.2.0 and higher. If
you want to use a version prior to v5.2.0, you can use the following snipped

```groovy
dependencies {
    cpd 'net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd:5.0.5'
}
```


Usage
-----

This plugin is available using either the new [Gradle plugins DSL](https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block)


```groovy
plugins {
    id 'de.aaschmid.cpd' version '1.0'
}
```

or the old fashion [buildscript block](https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:applying_plugins_buildscript) from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|gradle-cpd-plugin) or [jCenter](https://bintray.com/aaschmid/gradle-plugins/gradle-cpd-plugin/view).
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        // choose your prefered one
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'de.aaschmid:gradle-cpd-plugin:1.0'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'cpd'
```

**Attention:** The plugins groupId was changed from ```de.aaschmid.gradle.plugins``` to ```de.aaschmid``` in [v1.0][].

By default the copy-paste-detection looks at all source code of all projects which at least apply ```JavaBasePlugin```. If you use a different programming language and want to get it configurated out of the box, please open an issue :-)

### Single module project

If you have a single module project you just need to make sure that the ```JavaBasePlugin``` is also applied to it (explicitly or implicitly through e.g. Java or Groovy plugin). Otherwise you can simply add a dependency to a task you like by 

```groovy
analyze.dependsOn(cpdCheck)
```

### Multi module project 

If the root project of your multi-module project applies the ```JavaBasePlugin```, you are done. But most likely this is not how your project looks like. If so, you need to manually add a task graph dependency manually to either one or all of your subprojects such that the ```cpdCheck``` task is executed:

```groovy
// one single subproject where 'JavaBasePlugin' is available
subprojectOne.check.dependsOn(':cpdCheck')

// all subprojects where 'check' task is available (which comes with 'JavaBasePlugin')
subprojects {
    plugins.withType(JavaBasePlugin) { // <- just if 'JavaBasePlugin' plugin is not applied to all subprojects
        check.dependsOn(rootProject.cpdCheck)
    }
}
```

### Examples

This example shows a project where only  ```main``` sources should be checked for duplicates:

```groovy
// optional - settings for every CPD task
cpd {
    language = 'cpp'
    toolVersion = '5.2.3' // defaults to '5.4.2'; just available for v5.2.0 and higher (see explanation above)
}

// optional - default report is xml and default sources are 'main' and 'test'
cpdCheck {
    reports {
        text.enabled = true
        xml.enabled = false
    }
    source = sourceSets.main.allJava // only java, groovy and scala classes in 'main' sourceSets
}
```

*Note:* With v0.2, I have renamed the default task from ```cpd``` to ```cpdCheck``` that it does not have a name clash anymore.


Options
-------

This plugin supports the following options, either set for the plugin using ```cpd { }``` or for every task explicitly,
e.g. using ```cpdCheck { }```:

| Attribute          | Default              | Applies for ```language``` | since    |
| ------------------ |:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|

| ignoreAnnotations  | ```false```          | ```'java'```               | [v0.4][] |
| ignoreFailures     | ```false```          |                            | [v0.1][] |
| ignoreIdentifiers  | ```false```          | ```'java'```               | [v0.4][] |
| ignoreLiterals     | ```false```          | ```'java'```               | [v0.4][] |
| language           | ```'java'```         |                            | [v0.4][] |
| minimumTokenCount  | ```50```             |                            | [v0.1][] |
| skipDuplicateFiles | ```false```          |                            | [v0.5][] |
| skipLexicalErrors  | ```false```          |                            | [v0.5][] |
| skipBlocks         | ```true```           | ```'cpp'```                | [v0.4][] |
| skipBlocksPattern  | ```'#if 0|#endif'``` | ```'cpp'```                | [v0.4][] |

For more information about options and their descriptions, see [here](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/usage/cpd-usage.html#Options),
and for the available programming languages have a look on [CPD documentation](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/usage/cpd-usage.html#Supported_Languages).
To request more options, please file an issue [here](/../../issues).


Additionally, one can configure the following reports for every task analogous to
[Reporting](https://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.reporting.Reporting.html) as for any other reporting plugin. See also
the example in [Usage](#usage) section above.

| Report | Default  | Further options and their defaults    |
| ------ |:--------:| ------------------------------------- |
| csv    | disabled | ```separator = ','```                 |
| text   | disabled | ```lineSeparator = '====================================================================='```, ```trimLeadingCommonSourceWhitespaces = false``` |
| xml    | enabled  | ```encoding = <<System default>>```   |


Contributing
------------

You are very welcome to contribute by providing a patch/pull request.

Please note that running the test cases my take quite long becuase the acceptance test cases (see ```de.aaschmid.gradle.plugins.cpd.test.CpdAcceptanceTest``` will download [CPD][] and its dependencies for every version. I recommend to get these dependencies in your ```localMaven()``` repository as the test cases look there for it first.
